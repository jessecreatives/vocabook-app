# VocaBook: A streamlined vocabulary builder app

VocaBook is a simple app that helps you build your vocabulary in any language you learn.  
It's effective because it is developed by a language learner who has decades of learning experience.  
I have tried multiple vocabulary builder apps and all of them just disappointed me because:

1. They are complex both in functionality and look. I just want to log a new word/expressioin I encounter into a place and be able to get back and take a look later. However, those apps tend to have loads of functionalities and UI elements that are noisy.
2. They tend to support only one language. But there are so many people who are learning multiple languages at the same time.
3. They are not quite flexible. Most of the mentioned apps have several dictionaries preinstalled. They work by throwing the words that you have never met or will rarely use into your face. No, the best approach is to log your own words that you encountered in a real environment.
